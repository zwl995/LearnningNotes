# Papers/Notes on Daily Research

This repo contains some popular or classical papers in the research topics where I'm eager to devote to. I'm actively updating the papers I want to read and have read. Besides, I would like to update my reading notes on valuable papers and attach my implementations.

- Backbones/Architectures
  - Vanishing/Exploding Gradients
  - Optimization
  - Recurrent Neural Networks
  - Data Augmentation
